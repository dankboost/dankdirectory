Dank Directory is an organic NFT project built on the counterparty protocol using the bitcoin blockchain. With a focus on memes and crypto related content, Dank Directory aspires to be widely known and accessible venue for creating tokenized value. The directory was created by an early NFT pioneer, Boost, who created many early Rare Pepes, notably HOMERPEPE. The main currency of the directory, DANKMEMECASH, was airdropped to supporters of the project for the first 6 months after it's beginnings. This token is used for the submission process to the directory, similar to how PEPECASH was used for the Rare Pepe project. Dank Directory has successfully expanded the lense that "art" can be accessed and projected, but also conceived in terms of meaning and propogating value outside of the traditional rhetoric.
